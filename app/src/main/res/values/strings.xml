        <item>You might invest 35% on bonds because the life decisions you are making require you to
            remain somewhat conservative with your investments, and bonds have minimum risk. Bonds
            will give you a set amount of money back, and, with having kids, this can be a way of
            securing funds for their college education.

            You might invest 10% on international Stocks because the life decisions you are making
            require you to remain somewhat conservative with your investments because these stocks
            can be a risky investment, as the market can change it what seems like random ways.
            With a spouse, two kids, and a house you want something more stable to rely on for
            income, but the potential high payback is worth this small amount.
